## We Produce Premium Content in the Firearms and Gun-related Industries 
We own a few websites in the firearms industry. We are also a strategic Content Producer for brands that need content production without the hassle of payroll concerns, and without the difficulty and expense of running a well managed team of content producers in-house. We also do some digital agency work in marketing and SEO. We are experts in all of these fields, but we prioritize only the types of services and products that we do best. We have spent over a decade building a team of highly skilled and educated management and content producers that are focused on the firearms industry.  We also work on websites and projects that are in closely affiliated industries (like tactical items, e-commerce stores in the segment, knives, politics that explore Second Amendment topics, hunting, precision shooting, Military or LE products, etc.).
